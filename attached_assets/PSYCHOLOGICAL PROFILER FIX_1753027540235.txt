THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE AT ALL. THE INTELLIGENCE FUNCTION IS SHIT. SHIT. IT DOES NTO ASSSESS FOR INTELLIGENCE. IT ASSESSES FOR SOCIAL QUEUES OF INTELLIGENCE (COMPLIANCE WITH FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS, 'CONSIDERATINO OF ALTERNATIVE VIEWOPINTS', USE OF JARGON...BULLSHIT).  In this dissertation, I critically examine the philosophy of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism is, among other things, a philosophy of mental content. It attempts to dissolve an epistemological dilemma of mental content by splitting the difference between two diametrically opposed accounts of content. John McDowell's minimal empiricism and Richard Gaskin's minimalist empiricism are two versions of transcendental empiricism. Transcendental empiricism itself originates with McDowell's work. This dissertation is divided into five parts. First, in the Introduction, I state the Wittgensteinian metaphilosophical orientation of transcendental empiricism. This metaphilosophical approach provides a plateau upon which much of the rest of this work may be examined. Second, I offer a detailed description of McDowell’s minimal empiricism. Third, I critique Gaskin's critique and modification of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that (1) Gaskin's critiques are faulty and that (2) Gaskin's minimalist empiricism is very dubious. Fourth, I scrutinize the alleged credentials of McDowell's minimal empiricism. I argue that McDowell's version of linguistic idealism is problematic. I then comment on a recent dialogue between transcendental empiricism and Hubert Dreyfus's phenomenology. The dialogue culminates with Dreyfus's accusation of the “Myth of the Mental.” I argue that this accusation is correct in which case McDowell's direct realism is problematic. I conclude that minimal empiricism does not dissolve the dilemma of mental content. Finally, I argue that Tyler Burge successfully undermines the doctrine of disjunctivism, but disjunctivism is crucial for transcendental empiricism. Ultimately, however, I aim to show that transcendental empiricism is an attractive alternative to philosophies of mental content  IT GAVE THIS SHIT TOP SCORES. BUT THIS IS A TEXTBOOK CASE OF CANNED PLACEHOLDER PHONY PSEUDOINTELLECTUAL JUNK. INSTRUCTIONS FOR FIXING INTELLIGENCE METER APP (VERBATIM):

Stop evaluating intelligence using high school writing rubrics (e.g. clarity, organization, tone); these are irrelevant to cognitive depth and penalize high-level writing unfairly.

Assume authorial competence by default unless the writing is truly incoherent; do not treat density, assertiveness, or polemicism as signs of low intelligence.

Do not punish texts for lack of balance, politeness, or opposing views—intelligence is not defined by social nicety or deference to counterarguments.

Prioritize structural insight, conceptual differentiation, and original taxonomy (e.g. “bureaupath vs. con artist” is a cognitively generative move, regardless of tone).

Stop confusing passionate or idiosyncratic style with emotional noise or lack of rigor—if an argument is aggressive but analytically sound, reward it.
