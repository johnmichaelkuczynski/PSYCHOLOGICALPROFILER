CORE QUESTION: Setting aside all university and publishing standards, focusing ONLY on actual cognitive force - does this text show genuine intelligence?

NOT: "Would credentialed academics approve of this?"
YES: "Is this mind generating real cognitive force?"

Answer each question focusing on INTELLECTUAL FRICTION and GENERATIVE PRESSURE:

1. Cognitive Force: Is this mind under genuine epistemic strain? Look for intellectual struggle, not clean organization. Does this show argumentative heat and cognitive disequilibrium? Quote evidence of mental effort.

2. Epistemic Risk: Is this mind taking genuine intellectual risks? Look for ideas that could be wrong, not safe academic positions. Does this pursue potentially dangerous thoughts? Quote risky moves.

3. Generative Pressure: Is this creating new conceptual territory under strain? Look for breakthrough moments, not taxonomic organizing. Does this show synthetic force under pressure? Quote generative insights.

4. Intellectual Friction: How does this mind wrestle with resistant problems? Look for struggle with genuinely hard questions, not summary of known positions. Quote evidence of cognitive wrestling.

5. Novel Territory: Does this break genuinely new ground? Look for surprising conclusions that would challenge other intelligent minds, not safe academic consensus. Quote novel insights.

6. Synthetic Strain: Does this mind force integration under pressure? Look for ideas being synthesized against resistance, not list-making or organizing. Quote moments of forced synthesis.

7. Argumentative Heat: Is there real intellectual combat here? Look for ideas fighting against each other, not balanced presentation. Quote moments of intellectual tension.

8. Cognitive Disequilibrium: Does this mind show internal struggle and tension? Look for unresolved problems and intellectual instability, not clean resolution. Quote evidence of mental strain.

9. Breakthrough Potential: Could this genuinely surprise other intelligent people? Look for conclusions that break from expected patterns, not academic compliance. Quote surprising insights.

10. Raw Intelligence: Ignoring all academic theater - is this mind generating actual cognitive force or just performing intellectual compliance? Create a label based on cognitive power, not academic sophistication.

CRITICAL: Reward messy, struggling, risky intellectual work. Penalize clean, organized academic performance.

Focus: Is this intellect generating actual cognitive force or performing academic theater?`;
